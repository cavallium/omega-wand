# Ω-WAND

Fastest search algorithm in the world, 69420% faster than Lucene!

# Implementation

Its implementation is the first and only one that requires O(1) time and O(1) space!

# Source code

The source code is designed to be simple and highly maintainable.

It's 100% documented and the LOC count is kept as low as possible to minimize the possibility to have bugs.

# License

GPL

# Benchmarks

- Lucene: 90 seconds (I don't remember which query but idc to represent other software fairly)

- Ω-WAND: 1 microseconds (any query, any index size, any possible configuration, environment, os, hardware)


# Motivation

In the last 12 months _speed_ decreased worldwide:

This project aims to improve _speed_ worldwide.

# Inspiration

Thanks to this article https://yyhh.org/blog/2021/11/t-wand-beat-lucene-in-less-than-600-lines-of-code/ and this post on Y-Combinator https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29237644 I learned the necessary skills to unfairly advertise my barely working 600 lines project as better and faster than one of the best software in the world, developed by thousands of skilled people in twenty years.
