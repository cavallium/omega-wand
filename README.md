# Ω-WAND

Fastest search algorithm in the world, 69420% faster than Lucene!

# Implementation

Its implementation is the first and only one that requires O(1) time and O(1) space!

# Source code

The source code is designed to be simple and highly maintainable.

It's 100% documented and the LOC count is kept as low as possible to minimize the possibility to have bugs.

# Benchmarks

- Lucene: 90 seconds (I don't remember which query but idc to represent other software fairly)

- Ω-WAND: 1 microseconds (any query, any index size, any possible configuration, environment, os, hardware)


# Motivation

In the last 12 months _speed_ decreased worldwide:
